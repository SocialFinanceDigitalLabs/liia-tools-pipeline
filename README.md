This repository holds a set of tools and utilities for processing and cleaning Children's Services' data.

Most of the utilities are centred around three core datasets:

* SSDA903
* CIN Census
* Annex A

## Introduction to LIIA project 

The LIIA (London Innovation and Improvement Alliance) project brings together Childrenâ€™s Services data from all the 
Local Authorities (LAs) in London with the aim of providing analytical insights that are uniquely possible using 
pan-London datasets. 

 
Please see [LIIA Child Level Data Project](https://liia.london/liia-programme/targeted-work/child-level-data-project) 
for more information about the project, its aims and partners. 

## Purpose of liia-tools-pipeline package 

The package is designed to process data deposited onto the data platform by local authorities such that it can be used for analysis purposes.

This is a Dagster code server library which is setup to be used as a code server.

## How to use:

### Local Development
1. Run `poetry install`
2. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in the variables there as needed
3. Run the following command: `poetry run dagster dev -f .\liiatools_pipeline\repository.py`
4. Once running, navigate to http://localhost:3000/
5. Add the pre-commit hook by running `pre-commit install`. This will ensure your code is formatted before you commit something
   
### Preparation for Production or Staging
How this will run in production is that the library will be brought into a docker container
with configuration specified in the file `Dockerfile_user_code`.  Which code servers are used can
be specified in the installation. 
See [The SFDATA Platform's Workspace definition for details](https://github.com/SocialFinanceDigitalLabs/sfdata-platform/blob/main/dagster/workspace.yaml)

The idea is each code server will have its own setup which will be a copy of what's here.

Note: Multiple libraries, pipelines, etc can exist in a single code server. Different servers should
be used if they have conflicting requirements (e.g. different python versions)

### Deploying

docker build . -t dockerhubuser/repo:latest
docker tag dockerhubuser/repo:latest dockerhubuser/repo:some.version.number
docker push dockerhubuser/repo:latest
docker push dockerhubuser/repo:some.version.number
